# sutra.mk -- the family's shared RECIPE layer, vendored like code (see
# docs/BOOTSTRAP.md for the sibling code-vendoring mechanics). Include from
# a pill's own root Makefile:
#
#   PILL := coldspot
#   include src/share/coldspot/lib/sutra.mk
#
# PILL must be set before the include line. Everything else resolves
# relative to sutra.mk's OWN location -- $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST)) at
# include-time is exactly that path, however the including Makefile spelled
# it -- never to sutra's own repo. That is the design constraint: get it
# wrong and five pills each debug their own copy of the same mistake, which
# is the exact failure mode this file exists to close.
#
# 441 lines of this recipe were maintained by hand across five pills before
# this existed; check-sutra alone ranged 30-57 lines for what was nominally
# one thing, and every divergence the family suffered was a recipe, never
# vendored CODE (which has never drifted once, because it has a hash
# anchor -- see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). This is that same guard, extended to
# recipes: ship the recipe itself under the anchor, so a pill runs the
# current correct thing by construction instead of a snapshot someone
# copied by hand and never revisited.
#
# PILOT CORRECTIONS (Till, RAMstein, msg 2739 via Alfred): the first
# published form was validated against sutra itself and a fake pill built
# from the same head that authored it -- both share the author's own
# assumptions and neither could surface a gap only a REAL, independently-
# built consumer would hit. Four gaps found by RAMstein's real pilot
# adoption are fixed below; each is called out at its own site rather than
# only here, since "what changed" matters less than "why the first cut
# missed it."

# --- check-sutra: integrity (hard gate) + freshness (LAG/DRIFT) -----------
#
# Integrity: the vendored file's sha256 against its own .version anchor --
# hand-edited or corrupted, always a hard fail, no nuance.
#
# Freshness: the .commit anchor compared against canonical sutra's history
# for THAT FILE SPECIFICALLY -- `git -C "$canon" log -1 --format=%H --
# "<name>"` -- never canonical's repo HEAD, which advances on every commit
# including ones that never touch the file at all. That was the 0.7.3 fix
# (decision 325b1969, correcting d51e090f's original HEAD-compare, which
# false-positived a LAG warning across the whole family the first time a
# docs-only commit landed). It reached one pill by hand-copying before this
# file existed; the other four still carry the stale form. Recorded at or
# after the file's own last commit -> fresh. A strict ancestor of it ->
# LAG, the copy has genuinely fallen behind, warn only. Not in canonical's
# history at all -> DRIFT, hard fail.
#
# PILOT FIX 1 (Till/RAMstein): the first cut looped only sutra/sutra_update/
# sutra_xen -- the three .py modules living beside sutra.mk itself. But
# ByeByte, phanspeed AND RAMstein (three of four pills with a hand-written
# check-sutra today) also check pill.js, per BOOTSTRAP.md's own escape
# hatch ("extend the for mod in... line with pill.js") -- a hatch that
# never made it into this generalized form. Verbatim adoption would have
# silently DELETED an existing guard from three of five pills. pill.js
# lives in the extension dir, not the lib dir, and is .js not .py, so it
# cannot just join the same `for mod in ...` loop -- it needs its own path.
# SUTRA_EXT_DIR opts a pill in; empty (the default) skips it exactly like
# a pill with no extension should.
#
# PILOT FIX 5 (Werner, found mid-adoption in a real pill; confirmed by
# Alfred, msg 2768): the first cut of the branch below tested "$(SUTRA_EXT_DIR)"
# -- a Make-level expansion, substituted at parse time -- but then read the
# value back as "$${SUTRA_EXT_DIR%/}", a SHELL-level parameter expansion.
# SUTRA_EXT_DIR is a Makefile variable, never exported to the recipe's
# shell environment, so the shell's own $SUTRA_EXT_DIR was always empty:
# the `-n` test correctly saw a non-empty value and took the branch, then
# extdir resolved to nothing, the pill.js path became just "/pill.js", and
# _sutra_check_one's own not-vendored-here fallback reported a clean skip.
# check-sutra therefore exited 0 while covering nothing -- the exact defect
# PILOT FIX 1 above exists to close, reintroduced inside its own fix, and
# more dangerous than an ordinary failure because it reads as routine
# output rather than a red run. Fixed below by using $(SUTRA_EXT_DIR)
# (Make-level, via patsubst for the trailing-slash strip) consistently
# instead of mixing it with a shell-level read -- this removes the
# export/parse-order question entirely rather than requiring a pill to
# `export SUTRA_EXT_DIR` around the include, which was the workaround
# before this was understood.

# --- the checkout-run guard ------------------------------------------------
# Till's form (RAMstein tests/smoke.sh:296; maat, kast tests/smoke.sh:168):
# a binary that silently imported a DIFFERENT sutra.py off sys.path would
# still exit 0 -- rc=0 alone proves nothing about WHICH copy got imported.
# Prove the path Python actually bound, not a prediction of what it should be.
#
# CORRECTION (msg 2673, Alfred, caught by reproduction): the first cut of
# this target computed the EXPECTED path in shell from the bootstrap
# preamble's own formula and checked that a file exists there. That is a
# LAYOUT check, not a RESOLUTION check -- it never asks Python what the
# binary actually imported. A binary that forgot the bootstrap preamble
# entirely, sitting beside a stale co-located sutra.py (the exact
# pre-migration shape the whole ruling exists to clean up), would still
# import successfully (Python's own sys.path includes the script's own
# directory) and the shell arithmetic would still find a real file at the
# computed path -- green on the precise regression this guard exists to
# catch. Fixed: load the binary as a module for real and read back
# <module>.<SUTRA_CHECK_MODULE>.__file__, the path Python actually
# resolved, never a second shell computation of what it SHOULD be.
#
# SUTRA_CHECK_BIN is the pill-specific part: which binary to run.
# SUTRA_CHECK_MODULE is the attribute name the import binds (almost always
# "sutra"; a binary that only imports sutra_update, e.g. an update-spine-
# only tool, sets this to "sutra_update").
#
# DEFECT 5 (maat/kast, msg 2787): SUTRA_CHECK_BIN used to default to
# src/bin/$(PILL). Measured across five pills: that binary does not import
# sutra for two of them -- kast's src/bin/kast is the bash CLI (only
# kast-update imports sutra); phanspeed's src/bin/phanspeed has the same
# shape. A default that's wrong 40% of the time is a trap, not a default,
# and the failure it produces is confusing rather than obviously "you
# configured this wrong": line 262 only proves the path EXISTS, so a real
# file with no sutra binding gets run through the guard and fails looking
# like a broken vendor or a missing preamble, when the actual problem is
# that the wrong binary was named. No default here now -- every pill names
# its own sutra-importing binary explicitly, because a wrong guess that's
# sometimes right is worse than no guess: "I didn't set it and it passed"
# would be indistinguishable from "I set it correctly".
#
# SAFETY CORRECTION (Till/RAMstein pilot, escalated by Alfred as family-
# wide, not RAMstein-specific): the first cut defaulted SUTRA_CHECK_ARGS to
# "--help", on the assumption that's a universally safe, recognized flag.
# It is not. Three of RAMstein's four binaries hand-roll their own argument
# parsing rather than using argparse, so an unrecognized "--help" falls
# through to their DEFAULT VERB -- for ramstein/ramstein-healthcheck that
# means `make check` makes a REAL socket call to the LIVE daemon on every
# single run. Harmless there by RAMstein's own security model, but a pill
# whose default verb has a non-idempotent side effect would have this guard
# silently perform that side effect forever, unnoticed, because nothing
# about "the guard failed to print help" looks like an incident. tjmax's
# ACTUAL pattern (phanspeed Makefile:38-42) never assumed a generic flag --
# it uses "--selftest"/"--check", pill-specific flags the binary's own
# author added and verified are safe. So: no default here anymore.
# SUTRA_CHECK_ARGS is empty unless a pill sets it to a flag ITS OWN author
# has verified is safe and idempotent. Left empty, the real-subprocess
# sanity call below is skipped entirely -- this guard then relies solely on
# the resolution check, which never calls main() (a non-"__main__" module
# name, below) and is therefore safe against ANY binary regardless of how
# it parses arguments, known-safe flag or not.
